Create a shell script that performs the following mathematical operations using functions:
i. Calculate the square of a number
ii. Find the greatest common divisor (GCD) of two numbers

Note:
Handle only 1 menu at a time. DO NOT USE LOOP TO DISPLAY THE MENUS AGAIN AND AGAIN. IF YOU USE LOOP FOR MENUS THEN VALIDATE WILL TAKE LONG TIME.

Function Specifications:
calculate_square() – This function gets the number and calculates the square of that number.
find_gcd() – This function calculates the gcd of two numbers.

[All text in bold corresponds to input and the rest corresponds to output.]
