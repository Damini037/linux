Create a shell script that performs the following operations using functions:
i. Convert all text to uppercase in a file (input1.txt)
ii. Calculate the number of words in a file (input1.txt)
iii. Find the longest line in a file (input1.txt)
iv. Merge two files line by line (input1.txt and input2.txt)

Note:
Use SWITCH OR IF and handle 1 menu at a time. DO NOT USE LOOP TO HANDLE MENUS. IF YOU USE LOOP THEN VALIDATE WILL TAKE LONG TIME.

Function Specifications:

convert_to_uppercase() – This function converts all text in the file input1.txt to uppercase.
count_words() – This function calculates the number of words in the file input1.txt.
find_longest_line() – This function finds and displays the longest line in the file input1.txt.
merge_files() – This function merges two files input1.txt and input2.txt line by line.

Input Format: 

Give the input as a file.

Output Format:

Display the output in the console.
[All text in bold corresponds to input and the rest corresponds to output.]

Input File: (input1.txt)

Bash shell 

input1.txt after conversion:
