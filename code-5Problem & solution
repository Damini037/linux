Create a shell script that performs the following operations using functions:
i. Reverse the content of each line in a file (input1.txt)
ii. Check if a file contains a specific word (input1.txt)
iii. Count the number of unique words in a file (input1.txt)
iv. Display the first n lines of a file (input1.txt)

Note:
Use SWITCH OR IF and handle 1 menu at a time. DO NOT USE LOOP TO HANDLE MENUS. IF YOU USE LOOP THEN VALIDATE WILL TAKE LONG TIME.

Function Specifications:

reverse_content() – This function reverses the content of each line in the file.
check_word() – This function checks if a specific word is present in the file.
count_unique_words() – This function counts the number of unique words in the file.
display_first_n_lines() – This function displays the first n lines of the file.

Input Format: 

Give the input as a file.

Output Format:

Display the output in the console.
[All text in bold corresponds to input and the rest corresponds to output.]

Shell scripting involves creating text files that contain a sequence of commands to be executed by an operating system.
A bash script is a series of commands written in a file.
